# number_guesser.javascript
Number guesser game using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Part of the Codecademy projects category.

The code I wrote is in the script.js file. The other files are provided by Codecademy. 
The goal was to utilize what I had learned while going through the JavaScript syntax part 1 module, which covered functions.
